string x;
string y("ham is spam");//another way to create a string

getline(cin, x);//reads a complete line and stores it in x

x.substr(i, k);//a substring of x starting from index i and ending at i+k

x.swap(y);//swaps two strings with each other

y.find("am")//returns the location of first occurence of "am" in y//1

y.rfind("am")//returns the location of last occurence of "am" in y//9

y.erase(k);//erases all the characters from index k 

y.replace(i, k, "abc");//replaces the characters starting from index i to index i+k with "abc"

y.insert(i, "abc ");//inserts abc at index i in string
